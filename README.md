- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m Shreyak Chakraborty
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all kinds of innovative multi-stack software development primarily in JavaScript, Python and Golang stacks.
- ðŸ‘€ Also interested in AI & ML especially applications of Generative AI and training and studying about Deep Learning models in NLP and Computer Vision domains.
- Currently in my free time, I am working on various interesting simulations (see my repo: https://github.com/kernelshreyak/simulations) and machine learning techniques (https://github.com/kernelshreyak/ai-ml-learning) and looking at contributing to the codebases of open-source projects that I like.
